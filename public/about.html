<h1>About Me</h1>

<p> Hello! I'm Lochan Khatri, a dedicated and enthusiastic 3rd-year Computer Science Engineering student. 
  I graduated high school with a strong academic performance, earning 85% in my 12th grade.
   Currently, I have a CGPA of 7, reflecting my commitment to my studies.</p>

<p>I have a deep interest in technology and am always looking for ways to expand my knowledge. During my journey, 
  I completed a 1-month internship in Java development, where I worked on various projects, gaining valuable hands-on experience. 
  This internship allowed me to sharpen my programming skills and understand how to apply theory to real-world problems.</p>

<p>Currently, I am focusing on web development and enhancing my skills through online courses, such as those on Udemy. 
  I am eager to apply the knowledge Iâ€™ve gained in real-world situations and am actively exploring opportunities for growth.</p>
